## 🔧 JuliaOS Integration Highlights

### Agent Execution
The dApp implements multiple specialized JuliaOS agents:

```python
# Example agent implementation
class BlockchainDataAgent(Agent):
    async def collect_transaction_data(self, tx_hash, chain):
        result = await self.useLLM(
            prompt=f"Analyze transaction {tx_hash} on {chain}",
            context={"transaction_hash": tx_hash, "blockchain": chain}
        )
        return self.parse_transaction_data(result)
```

### Swarm Orchestration
Complex analysis scenarios utilize JuliaOS swarm capabilities:

```python
class TransactionTraceSwarm(Swarm):
    async def execute_complex_trace(self, tx_hash, options):
        # Coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive analysis
        data_tasks = [
            self.data_collector.collect_transaction_data(tx_hash, chain)
            for chain in options.get('chains', ['ethereum', 'bsc'])
        ]
        return await self.coordinate_parallel_execution(data_tasks)
```

### Onchain Functionality
Direct blockchain interaction through JuliaOS onchain interfaces:

```python
async def query_transaction_details(self, tx_hash, chain):
    return await self.onchain.execute_query(
        chain=chain,
        query_type='transaction_details',
        parameters={'tx_hash': tx_hash}
    )
```
