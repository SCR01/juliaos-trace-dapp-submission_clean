## Todo List

### Phase 1: Read and analyze the bounty requirements
- [x] Read the uploaded document to understand the JuliaOS bounty requirements, evaluation criteria, and technical specifications.

### Phase 2: Design the dApp architecture and concept
- [x] Design a winning dApp concept that meets all bounty requirements and stands out for the first prize.
- [x] Outline the dApp architecture, including agent design, swarm integration (if applicable), and onchain interactions.
- [x] Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks for the frontend and backend.

### Phase 3: Develop the smart contracts

- [x] Ensure backend services support JuliaOS agent execution and swarm coordination.

### Phase 6: Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Write a detailed README with setup instructions, JuliaOS usage, and demo link.
- [x] Create API documentation for smart contracts and backend services.
- [x] Develop a deployment guide and user manual.

### Phase 7: Test and deploy the dApp
- [x] Conduct thorough testing of all dApp components.
- [x] Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.
- [x] Deploy the dApp to appropriate networks.

### Phase 8: Deliver final package to user
